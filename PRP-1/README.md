**Open-source Code for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimisation of Spinodoid Cellular Materials**

This repository introduces a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (MOBO) framework for optimising spinodoid structuresâ€”scalable, non-periodic topologies with efficient stress distributionâ€”to enhance crush energy absorption under impact. The framework addresses the challenge of balancing conflicting objectives: maximising energy absorption while minimising peak forces, accounting for non-linear material behavior and plastic deformation. By integrating finite element analysis (FEA) with Bayesian optimisation, it efficiently navigates the design space, reducing computational costs compared to conventional methods (e.g., NSGA-II). Key features include:

- Pareto-optimal solutions via scalarisation and hypervolume techniques.

- Avoidance of structural densification to maintain integrity.

- Superior performance over NSGA-II in computational efficiency and solution quality.

Ideal for real-world structural/material optimisation where complex trade-offs and non-linear dynamics are critical.

Figure 1: Visualisation of changes in two design parameters using graded spinodoids. Both structures were produced with $\theta_1 = 90^\circ, \theta_2 = 0^\circ, \theta_3 = 0^\circ$. (a) A linearly graded generated with an increasing relative density from left to right. The left side has the lowest relative density, starting at 0.3, the middle portion has a relative density of 0.45, and the right side reaches a relative density of 0.6. (b) A structure illustrating an increase in the wave number from left to right. The left side has the lowest wave number of $4\pi$, the right has the highest at $20\pi$, and the middle portion has an intermediate value of $12\pi$. It should be noted that these structures serve as a visualisation tool and do not represent the structures being optimised.

Figure 2: A schematic of the multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (MOBO) process for optimising the spinodoid cellular structure design space involves four steps of the data-driven process. (1) Initial Dataset Creation: Sampling 50 points from the design space using the Sobol' sequence and evaluate them with FEM simulations to build the initial dataset. (2) Surrogate Model Update: Updating the Gaussian Process model based on the dataset to predict structural properties. (3) Identifying samples to evaluate: Using an acquisition function to identify and evaluate the most promising design points. (4) FEM Simulations: Performing FEM analysis on generated structures and extracting objectives to then update the dataset.

## ðŸš€ Running Jobs

### **Basic Usage**  
Run the optimisation workflow with:  
```bash  
python main.py
```  

#### **Input Parameters** (edit `config.yaml`)  
- `input_columns`: Design parameters.
- `n_iterations`: Number of MOBO iterations used as stopping criteria
- `kernel`: Type of kernel used for covariance calculation
- `MOBO_type`: MOBO methods as described in the article
- `apply_transform`: If True, scales the objectives for them to be maximised.
  
#### **Output Parameters** (edit `config.yaml`)  
- `output_columns`: Parameters to output, maximised by default
- **Pareto-optimal designs**: Saved to `hydra_output_dir/pareto_front.csv`.
- **Optimisation History**: Saved to `hydra_output_dir/optimisation_history.csv`.  
- **Simulation logs**: Stored in `hydra_output_dir/main.log`.  

### **Example Workflow**  
1. Define objectives in `config.yaml`:  
   ```yaml  
   objectives:  
     EA 
     Peak_Force
   ```  

2. Start optimisation:  # change mode in main.py if running framework either locally or on cluster
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

3. Analyse results:  
   - View Pareto front: `hydra_output_dir/pareto_front.csv`.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes  
- **Hardware**: Simulations are computationally intensive. Use HPC/cluster for large-scale runs.  
- **Troubleshooting**:  
  - If FEA fails, check `<job_name>.o<job_id>`.  
  - Mesh density can be changed in /MOBO_standalone/spinodal_resources/Objective_Spinodoid_Tet.m by changing the res variable for faster debugging.
